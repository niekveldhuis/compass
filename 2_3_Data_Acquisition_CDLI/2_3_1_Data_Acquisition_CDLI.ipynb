    "The downloadable [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) files are found on the download page http://cdli.ucla.edu/bulk_data. The data available are a set of transliterations and a catalog file with meta-data. Because of its size the catalog file is currently split in two, it is possible that in the future there will be either more or fewer such files. The script identifies the file names and downloads those to a directory `cdlidata`. Once downloaded the catalog is reconstituted as a single file and is loaded into a `pandas` DataFrame. The DataFrame is used, by way of example, to select the transliterations from the Early Dynastic IIIa period.\n"

    "In the example code in the following cell the catalog is used to select from the transliteration file all texts from the Early Dynastic IIIa period.

The function `zfill()` is used to created a 6-digit number with leading zeros, if necessary. The P-numbers of our catalog selection are stored in the variable `pnos` (but note that the numbers do not have the initial 'P'!).\n",

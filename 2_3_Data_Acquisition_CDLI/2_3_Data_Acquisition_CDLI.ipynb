    "\n",
    "The [Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative](http://cdli.ucla.edu), created by [Bob Englund](https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=robert-k-englund) (UCLA) in the early two thousands, is a central repository for meta-data, images, and transliterations of cuneiform objects (translations are offered only for a small minority of texts). Today more than 335,000 objects are listed in the [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) catalog, with tens of thousands of photographs and line drawings. Each object in [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) receives a unique ID number (the so-called P-number), and these numbers are widely used today in print and in on-line projects. Initially, [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) focused primarily on administrative texts from the third millennium, and this is still the area of its greatest strength. Currently, approximately 121,000 texts are available in transliteration in [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu). Part of this corpus was produced by the [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) team at UCLA, others were contributed by partners or were imported from other projects such as [ETCSL](https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/) (for Sumerian literary texts), [DCCLT](http://oracc.org/dcclt) (for lexical texts), or [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/) (for Ur III administrative texts). The photographs on [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) were largely produced in cooperative projects with museums all over the world, where [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) staff or partners would go to scan an entire collection or major parts of a collection. These images are copyright of the museum where the object is held and there is no wholesale downloading of the entire image set.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/cdli_logo.gif\n",
    ":figclass: margin\n",
    ":scale: 50%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) project transformed the practice of Assyriology in multiple ways. The availability of large numbers of photographs made it possible to collate problematic passages in texts only published in transliteration and/or hand drawing. Issuing ID numbers made it easier to refer to a particular tablet unambiguously, while avoiding the confusion of obscure publication abbreviations and museum numbers. The spread of all this information on the web made it available to everyone with an internet connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each cuneiform object the [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) catalog provides information about where it was published (and by whom), in which collection it is kept, where it was excavated, to which period it belongs, what textual genre it represents, etc. In addition, an object may be represented by one or more images (photographs and/or hand drawings) and by a transliteration. Several of the fields in the [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) catalog either use a restricted vocabulary (period, genre) or have been standardized (provenance, author's name, owner, museum number), greatly facilitating search. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue of standardization is much more difficult for linguistic data in transliteration. Here, Sumerian and Akkadian pose rather different challenges. For Sumerian, there are two main issues. First, Sumerologists tend to use different sets of conventions for representing Sumerian words in the Latin alphabet. The word for \"to give\" is read [**šum₂**](http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0039914) by some, but **sum** by others. Similarly, the word for \"ox\" is read either [**gud**](http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0028670) or **gu₄**. These readings (**šum₂** vs **sum** or **gud** vs. **gu₄**) represent the same word and render the same cuneiform sign - they simply differ in modern transliteration conventions. Variation in such conventions has grown recently by the introduction of a new set of readings by P. Attinger (Bern), which has received wide following, in particular in Germany. Such variation in sign readings is based on the one hand on differing interpretations of the data from [ancient sign lists](http://oracc.org/dcclt/signlists) (which provide transcriptions of Sumerian words in Akkadian) and on the other hand on the definition of what an ideal transliteration should achieve (whether it should represent the abstract lexeme, or rather its concrete pronunciation, or something in between). For the [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) search engine, which is based on a FileMaker database, such variation presents a problem when searching for (Sumerian) words. The solution has been to strictly impose a set of [preferred sign readings](https://cdli.ucla.edu/methods/sign_reading.html), a policy that has been carried out with admirable consistency. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Attinger readings\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "For the readings introduced by P. Attinger, see the introduction to his [Glossaire sumérien–français](https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/isbn_9783447116169.ahtml) (2021).\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, Sumerologists today have no good standard for word segmentation. In the [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) data set one may find the word [**ninda-i₃-de₂-a**](http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0036259) (a pastry) transliterated as **ninda-i₃-de₂-a**, **ninda i₃-de₂-a**, **ninda i₃ de₂-a**, **nig₂-i₃-de₂-a**, **nig₂ i₃ de₂-a**, etcetera (**nig₂** and **ninda** are two different words, written by the same sign and there is no full agreement which of these is to be used in this particular expression). None of these various renderings is necessarily \"wrong,\" because we know fairly little about the formation and segmentation of Sumerian nouns. For computational approaches this variation poses an important challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Akkadian the variation in reading conventions plays a much smaller role; for most dialects of Akkadian (with the exception of Old Akkadian) scholars generally agree on transliteration conventions; word segmentation is hardly ever a problem. For search engines, however, Akkadian transliteration is much more difficult to deal with because the same word may be spelled in many different ways. Without lemmatization, there is no way a machine can tell that ***ša-ar-ru-um***, ***ša-ar-ri-im***, ***ša-ar-ra-am***, ***šar-ru***, ***šar-ri***, ***šar-ra***, **LUGAL**, and **MAN** all represent forms of the same word for \"king\" in syllabic and logographic writing. The rich morphology of Akkadian, with prefixes, suffixes, and infixes and various vowel patterns to be applied to different forms of a single verb further complicates this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) does not offer lemmatization, searching for words on this site is much more popular (and more useful) for Sumerian than it is for Akkadian. Sumerian words usually include the root of the word (written logographically) with prefixes and/or suffixes attached. Although spelling variations exist (e.g. **dag-si**, **da-ag-si**, **da-ag-ši-um**, and **da-ag-zi-um**, all representing variants of the word [dagsi](http://oracc.org/epsd2/o0025593) for saddle hook or saddle bag), such variation plays a much smaller role in Sumerian than in Akkadian."

    "There are various ways in which one can acquire [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) data. The website includes a [Downloads](https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=downloads) page where one can get access to a daily clone of the catalog and the entire set of transliterations. Alternatively, one can perform a search on the [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) search page and request a download of the data (transliteration only or catalog and transliteration data) by pushing a button. This works well for a few or several dozens of texts, but not for very large data sets.

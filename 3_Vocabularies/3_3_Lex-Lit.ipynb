    "In section [3.2](./3_2_Lit_Lex.ipynb) we asked whether we can see differences between Old Babylonian literary compositions in their usage of vocabulary (lemmas and MWEs) attested in the lexical corpus. In this notebook we will change perspective and ask: are there particular lexical texts (or groups of lexical texts) that show a greater engagement with literary vocabulary than others?\n",

    "In [3.1](./3_1_Lit_Lex_Vocab.ipynb) and [3.2](./3_2_Lit_Lex.ipynb) we used Multiple Word Expressions, connecting words that are found in a lexical entry by underscores (using `MWEtokenizer()` from the `nltk` module). The lemmas and MWE were visualized in Venn diagrams to illustrate the intersection between lexical and literary vocabulary.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, the parameter `ngram_range` is set to (1, 5). With this parameter, `Countvectorizer()` will create a column for each word (ngram n=1), but also for each sequence of two words (bigram; n=2), or three words (trigram; n=3), etc. \n",

In order to limit the its size somewhat we use the vocabulary `lit_lex_vocab` which contains all lemmas and lexical entries shared by the lexical and literary corpora. These are the relevant vocabulary items that we wish to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, instead of creating a DTM for lexical *documents* we will use `CountVectorizer()` on the lexical corpus in *line* format, rather than in document format. This is important, because we do not want the ngrams to jump over line boundaries. The resulting DTM, therefore, is more properly called a Line Term Matrix, providing frequencies of terms (and ngrams) for each line in the lexical corpus. In the next step we group the data by text ID and aggregate the line-based frequencies to create a proper DTM. The `aggregate()` function, in this case, is `sum`: for every word or ngram we need the summation of the frequencies of all the lines of each lexical composition.\n",

    "`Countvectorizer()` is used here on the raw data in `lex_lines`, including unlemmatized words. By including the unlemmatized words, we prevent creating articifial ngrams that consist of one term before and one term after an illegible word. Thus, the lemma sequence **dumu\\[child\\]n x\\[na\\]na lugal\\[king\\]n** will *not* match the bigram **dumu\\[child\\]n lugal\\[king\\]n**. Since `lit_lex_vocab` has no entries that contain **\\[na\\]na**, meaningless ngrams such as **dumu\\[child\\]n x\\[na\\]na** are filtered out automatically."

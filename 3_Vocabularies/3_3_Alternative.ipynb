    "\n",
    "In section 3.2 we asked whether we can see differences between Old Babylonian literary compositions in their usage of vocabulary (lemmas and MWEs) attested in the lexical corpus. In this notebook we will change perspective and ask: are there particular lexical texts (or groups of lexical texts) that show a greater engagement with literary vocabulary than others?\n",

    "In [3.1](./3_1_Lit_Lex_Vocab.ipynb) and [3.2](./3_2_Lit_Lex.ipynb) we used Multiple Word Expressions, connecting words that are found in a lexical entry by underscrores (using `MWEtokenizer()` from the nltk module). The lemmas and MWE were used visualized in Venn diagrams to illustrate the intersection between lexical and literary vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use the ngram option of the `CountVectorizer()` function in order to find sequences of lemmas that are shared between lexical and literary texts. A ngram is a continuous sequence of *n* words (or lemmas). \n",

    "\n",
    "In large part, this notebook uses the same techniques and the same code as section 3.2 did, and the reader is referred there for further explanation. In some aspects, however, the process is different. In particular, we will use various aspects of `CountVectorizer()` and the related function `TfidfVectorizer()` to understand the relationship in more detail."

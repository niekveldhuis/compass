    "\n",
    "In section 3.2 we asked whether we can see differences between Old Babylonian literary compositions in their usage of vocabulary (lemmas and MWEs) attested in the lexical corpus. In this notebook we will change perspective and ask: are there particular lexical texts (or groups of lexical texts) that show a greater engagement with literary vocabulary than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3.1](./3_1_Lit_Lex_Vocab.ipynb) and [3.2](./3_2_Lit_Lex.ipynb) we used Multiple Word Expressions, connecting words that are found in a lexical entry by underscrores (using `MWEtokenizer()` from the nltk module). The lemmas and MWE were used visualized in Venn diagrams to illustrate the intersection between lexical and literary vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use the ngram option of the `CountVectorizer()` function in order to find sequences of lemmas that are shared between lexical and literary texts. A ngram is a continuous sequence of *n* words (or lemmas). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In large part, this notebook uses the same techniques and the same code as section 3.2 did, and the reader is referred there for further explanation. In some aspects, however, the process is different. In particular, we will use various aspects of `CountVectorizer()` and the related function `TfidfVectorizer()` to understand the relationship in more detail."

    "When ordered by `norm` the top of the list is formed by lexical compositions such as the sign lists [OB Nippur Ea](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q000055) and [OB Nippur Diri](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q000057), the acrographic list/list of professions [OB Nippur Lu](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q000047), and the acrographic lists [OB Nippur Izi](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q000050), and [OB Nippur Kagal](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q000048), or (large) exemplars of such compositions. If we restrict the DataFrame to composites (Q numbers) only, this comes out even clearer. All these lexical texts belong to what Jay Crisostomo has labeled \"ALE\": Advanced Lexical Exercises ([Translation as Scholarship](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501509810); SANER 22, 2019). These exercises belong to the advanced first stage of education, just before students would start copying literary texts. The thematic lists collected in [Ura](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q000039,Q000040,Q000001,Q000041,Q000042,Q000043) (lists of trees, wooden objects, reeds, reed objects, clay, pottery, hides, metals and metal objects, animals, meat cuts, fish, birds, plants, etc.) have much lower `norm` values and thus less overlap with literary vocabulary."

    "### Important Words: TF-IDF\n",
    "What the above analysis does not take into aacount is the significance of the matching words. Words such as **igi\\[eye\\]n** or **šag\\[heart\\]n** are used in many kinds of expressions and will be found in all literary compositions, except for the most fragmentary ones. Those words are matched by the list [Ugumu](http://oracc.org/dcclt/Q002268) (list of body parts) but such matches are much less meaningful than a rarer word or expression like **nir\\[stone\\]n babbardil\\[~stone\\]n** (a type of agate with a single white stripe) which is fairly common in the lexical tradition, but only appears in one place in the literary corpus ([UET 6/3 561](http://oracc.org/epsd2/literary/P346598)) and with some frequency in administrative documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to distinguish between more and less significant matches we will compute the [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf) value for each word or expression in each literary document. Tf-idf is short for term frequency - inverse document frequency and is a widely used measure (or rather a class of measures) for weighing the importance of a word in a document. Term frequency refers to the frequency of a term in a document; a term that is more frequently used is probably important in that document. Document frequency refers to the number of documents in the corpus in which the term is found. A term that is found in the great majority of documents has little distinguishing value. A high document frequency, therefore, results in a lower relevance of the term. Thus the tf-idf value of words like **igi\\[eye\\]n** or **šag\\[heart\\]n** in any document, even though they may appear very frequently, is expected to be low because they appear in almost every document. On the other hand, the tf-idf value of **nir\\[stone\\]n babbardil\\[~stone\\]n** in [UET 6/3 561](http://oracc.org/epsd2/literary/P346598) is going to be fairly low, too, because the word appears only once in that text. A high value is associated with high frequency in a few documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute tf-idf values for the literary corpus with `TfidfVectorizer()` from the `sklearn` package. `TfidfVectorizer()` is a close relative of `CountVectorizer()` and works in essentially the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "> # Note: \n",
    "This is probably not a good idea. It is too complex, with computing means, adding up means and taking the mean of means - not a good way to introduce tf-idf. Probably better to explore in more detail the kinds of words that are matched."

The most common use case is a corpus of raw documents (probably in English), each of them consisting of a text string that needs to be pre-processed  and tokenized (turned into a list of words or lemmas) before anything else can be done. Default pre-processing includes, for instance, lowercasing the entire text (so that thursday, Thursday, and THURSDAY will all be recognized as the same lemma) and removal of punctuation and numbers. Default tokenizers assume that the text is in a modern (western) language, taking spaces, hyphens, and punctuation marks as word dividers. The structure of the [ORACC](http://oracc.org) data is much simpler than that. Pre-processing is unnecessary, and tokenization should split the string *only* at blank spaces.\n",

    "Among the words, currenly not found in the lexical corpus, are a remarkable number of proper nouns: Divine Names (Ama≈ãe≈°tinanak, Durtur, and ≈äe≈°tindudu), and Geographical names (Arali, Kubire≈°, and Kubire≈°dildare≈°). The case of Arali is instructive. This word appears in OB Nippur Izi, but is lemmatized there as a noun (a word for the Netherworld), rather than as a Geographical Name. The goddess Ama≈ãe≈°tinanak (**{d}ama-≈ãe≈°tin-an-na**) is well-attested in third millennium administrative texts and royal inscriptions, but is uncommon in the Old Babylonian period. In fact, the text of [Dumuzid's Dream](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1.4.3&display=Crit&charenc=gcirc#) writes ama {d}≈ãe≈°tin-an-na \"Mother ≈äe≈°tinanak\" - where \"Mother\" is an apparent honorific. Read that way, the word **ama** (mother) and the Divine Name **{d}≈ãe≈°tin-an-na** are present in the lexical corpus.\n",

    "The word men\\[go\\]v/i is an Emesal word. Emesal is a variety of Sumerian that is used in cultic laments and in speeches by female divinities in Sumerian myths. Although the Old Babylonian lexical corpus includes some Emesal words, they are truly rare. Generally speaking, Emesal is associated with the liturgical use of Sumerian, whereas the scribal school focuses primarily on regular Sumerian."

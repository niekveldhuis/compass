    "# Extract Lemmatization from JSON: Basic Parser\n",
    "The code in this notebook will parse [ORACC](http://oracc.org) `JSON` files to extract lemmatization data for one or more projects. The resulting `csv` (Comma Separated Values) file is named `parsed.csv` and has two fields: a Text ID (e.g. `dcclt/Q000039`) and a string of lemmas in the format `lugal[king]N` (or `šarru[king]N` for Akkadian texts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the Basic Parser contains *only* text IDs and lemmas. This format is useful for so-called [bag of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) techniques such as word clouds or [topic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model). The `JSON` files, however, contain a wealth of other data, including language (Sumerian, Akkadian, Emesal, etc.), orthographic form, morphology (currently only for Sumerian and Emesal), line numbers, breakage, meta-data, etc. The extended JSON parser notebook (####), building upon the techniques demonstrated here, will  show how to extract any type of data."

This way the function digs deeper and deeper into the `JSON` tree, until it does not encounter a `cdl` key anymore. Here we are at the level of individual words.

    "# Build Sign Search for BDTNS\n",
    "Goal of this notebook is to search the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) data by signs, irrespective of their reading. For instance, the sign NE may be read bi₂, ne, izi, šeŋ₆, kum₂, lam₂, zah₂, etc. It is easy to search for transliteration (and/or metadata) in the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) search page, but there is currently no way to search for a sequence of signs. This is useful, in particular, in two situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sumerological transliteration conventions may differ quite substantially between different schools. Thus, lu₂ kin-gi₄-a, {lu₂}kin-gi₄-a, lu₂ kiŋ₂-gi₄-a and {lu₂}kiŋ₂-gi₄-a all represent the same sequence of signs and the same word (meaning 'messenger'), but without knowledge of the particular set of conventions used it may be difficult to guess which search will yield the desired results. In the sign search one may enter sign readings according to any convention recognized by the ORACC Global Sign List ([OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In some cases the correct reading and interpretation of a sign sequence may be unclear and this ambiguiuty may have been resolved in different ways throughout the database. The names lugal-mudra₅, lugal-zuluhu₂ and lugal-siki-su₁₃ all represent the same sign sequence. Which of these is correct is not entirely clear (although the third seems unlikely) and, depending on the research question, may even be unimportant (for instance for an SNA analysis). In the sign search one may enter any of these forms and the results will include all of them."

    "# 6 Tokenizing Signs\n",
    "In order to search by sign, we need to tokenize signs in the transliteration column (`text`) while ignoring elements such as question marks or (half-) brackets. First step is to define different types of separators, and flags that may be present in the text or in the sign name. The most common separators are space and hyphen. Curly brackets are placed around determinatives (semantic classifiers), as in {d}En-lil₂ (\"the god Enlil\"). Curly brackets and hyphens will be replaced by spaces. The separators in `separators2` are used in compound signs, as in |SI.A|, or |ŠU+NIGIN|. Operators, finally, are also used in compound signs and indicate how the signs are written in relation to each other (on top of each other, one inside the other, etc.). Compound signs that represent a sequence of simple signs (|SI.A| for **dirig** or |A.TU.GAB.LIŠ| for **asal₂**) will be decomposed in their component signs. Compound signs of the type |KA×GAR| (for **gu₇**) are not analyzed, but their component parts are aligned with [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) practices (that is |KA×NINDA| will be re-written as |KA×GAR|, because in [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) GAR is the name of the sign that can be read **ninda** or **gar**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the flags include various characters that may appear in the transliteration but will be ignored in the search. A search for `ninda`, therefore, will find `ninda`, `[nin]da`, `ninda?`, etc., as well as `gar`, `⸢gar⸣`, `gar!(SIG)`, etc. (but not `nagar`, see below).\n",

Widgets are pieces of software that allow a user to interact with functions through text boxes, sliders, buttons, drop-down menus, check boxes, etc. These widgets contain code in javascript and are treated differently in Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab. Jupyter Notebook allows the embedding of any kind of javascript code. For safety reasons, this is not the case in Jupyter Lab. The Jupyter widgets need to be installed as a Jupyter Lab extension before they can be run; enabling Jupyter Lab extensions, in turn, requires `node.js`. For more information about installing and enabling the extension (including node.js) see [install_packages.ipynb](../1_Preliminaries/install_packages.ipynb). For detailed information about widgets, see [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",

    "- Button - when clicked, the search function is called\n",
    "- Text - a text box in which the user may enter a sequence of signs; after hitting ENTER (or clicking the Search button) the search function is called\n",
    "- BoundIntText - a text box that indicates the maximum number of hits (default is 25)\n",
    "- Checkbox - when checked (default) the search results display active links to BDTNS pages. When maximum hits is set to larger than 250 the default becomes unchecked.\n",
    "- Dropdown - a drop-down menu for arranging the search results by different columns.\n",

Second is a function that defines what happens when the button is clicked, or when the user hits the ENTER button. Third, a method for each of the widgets defines what event will trigger the function. For the button it is the event `on_click`, for the text box it is `on_submit` (that is, when the user hits ENTER); the other three widgets listen for a change in value with the `observe` method. Finally, the VBox and HBox widgets define the layout. "

To be useful, this interface requires a fairly fast machine because the search will update live while you type.

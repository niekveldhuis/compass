    "[ORACC](http://oracc.org) `zip` files contain JSON files for each individual text (exemplar or composite) that is part of that project. These files are found in the directory `corpusjson` and are named after the text ID (for instance `P200931.json`). The `parse_text_json()` function (2.1.3.3) extracts basic lemmatization data from each of those files. In the next section (2.1.4) we will review techniques to extract other types of information from these same files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the JSON files for text editions is fairly complex, because of the hierarchical structure of textual data. A text may have one or more surfaces (obverse, reverse), each surface may have one or more columns; each column has lines; each line has words; and each word has signs.\n",

    "\n",
    "How many of those layers are present in a particular text is impossible to predict. Some tablets have columns, others do not; most surfaces have text, but not all surfaces do. In addition, a text consists of textual units, such as paragraphs, sentences, phrases and words, which form a separate hierarchy.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [ORACC](http://oracc.org) JSON tree for a text edition consists of a hierarchy of `cdl` keys. The name `cdl` is based on the three main components of the nested tree: Chunks (text units), Discontinuities (physical units), and Lemmas (words). A Chunk is a chunk of text of any length: the body of the text, a sentence, a phrase, a word, etc. A Discontinuity is the text object, the obverse or reverse, the beginning of a column, a break in the text, a horizontal ruling on the tablet, or the beginning of a new line. A Lemma is the lemmatization of a single word in the text, including the information on the sign level. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a `cdl` key is a list of one or more dictionaries. Each of these dictionaries contains the key \"node\" which may have the values \"c\" (for Chunk), \"d\" (for Discontinuity), or \"l\" (for Lemma). Any \"c\" dictionary may contain a further `cdl` key, which again has as its value a list of dictionaries of the \"c\", \"d\", or \"l\" type. The \"c\" and \"d\" dictionaries always have a key `type`, which may have values such as `text`, `discourse`, or `sentence` (for \"c\" nodes) or `object`, `obverse`, `column-start`, `line-start` (for \"d\" nodes). Discontinuities (or \"d\" nodes\") may also have `type : nonx`, recording non-textual physical features such as rulings on the tablet, or missing lines. An \"l\" (Lemma) dictionary, is always at the bottom of the `cdl` hierarchy. The \"l\" dictionary itself contains an \"f\" key which has as its value a dictionary that contains all the lemmatization data of a single word (transliteration, citation form, guide word, part of speech, etc.). The \"f\" dictionary includes a \"gdl\" key (for Grapheme Description Language), which identifies the graphemes (cuneiform signs) of which the word is composed, with information on the reading and the function (syllabogram, logogram, determinative, etc.) of those graphemes. \n",

If we parse data from multiple projects this additional field will allow us to trace back to the original data.\n",

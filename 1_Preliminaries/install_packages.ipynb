A package needs to be *imported* every time when a script is started. It needs to be *installed* only once (and updated subsequently, if necessary). An example of a package that will need to be installed is `pyldavis`, a visualization tool for topic modeling, which we will use in Chapter 5.\n",

    "Installing packages can be a rather frustrating experience. The issue is that a computer may have more than one instance of Python installed (this is not unusual). In order to use Python packages within a Jupyter Notebook, they need to be associated with the so-called Python *kernel* that runs in the background of the notebook. For a more technical description of the issue and a solution see the [article](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/12/05/installing-python-packages-from-jupyter/) by Jake VanderPlas in his [Pythonic Preambulations](https://jakevdp.github.io/) blog. \n",

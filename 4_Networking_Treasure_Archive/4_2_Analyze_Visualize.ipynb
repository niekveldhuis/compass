In a spring layout (also called Fruchterman-Reingold layout) the edges function as springs that draw the nodes together; the strength of the spring (`draw_weight`) often depends on the weight of the edge, but may also be calculated differently. The nodes themselves repel each other; the replling force is often by the degree. The spring layout may result in a slightly different visualization each time it is run, but the general relationships of nodes and edges will be approximately the same.\n",

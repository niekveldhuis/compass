    "The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature ([ETCSL]; 1998-2006) provides editions and translations of 394 Sumerian literary compositions. Goal of this Notebook is to format the [ETCSL] data in such a way that the (lemmatized) texts are made available for computational text analysis. The [ETCSL] lemmatizations are made compatible with [ORACC] standards (see [ePSD2](http://oracc.org/epsd2/sux), so that [ETCSL] and [ORACC] data can be mixed and matched for text analysis purposes.\n",

    "### 1.1 XML\n",
    "The [ETCSL] files as distributed by the [Oxford Text Archive](http://ota.ox.ac.uk/desc/2518) are encoded in a dialect of `XML` (Extensible Markup Language) that is referred to as `TEI` (Text Encoding Initiative). In this encoding each word (in transliteration) is an *element* that is surrounded by `<w>` and `</w>` tags. Inside the start-tag the word may receive several attributes, encoded as name/value pairs, as in the following random examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<w form=\"ti-a\" lemma=\"te\" pos=\"V\" label=\"to approach\">ti-a</w>\n",
    "<w form=\"e2-jar8-bi\" lemma=\"e2-jar8\" pos=\"N\" label=\"wall\">e2-jar8-bi</w>\n",
    "<w form=\"ickila-bi\" lemma=\"ickila\" pos=\"N\" label=\"shell\"><term id=\"c1813.t1\">ickila</term><gloss lang=\"sux\" target=\"c1813.t1\">la</gloss>-bi</w>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `form` attribute is the full form of the word, omitting flags (such as question marks), indication of breakage, or glosses. The `lemma` attribute is the form minus morphology. Some lemmas may be spelled in more than one way in Sumerian; the `lemma` attribute will use a standard  spelling (note that the `lemma` of \"ti-a\" is \"te\"). The `lemma` in [ETCSL] (unlike `Citation Form` in [ORACC]) uses actual transliteration with hyphens and sign index numbers (as in `lemma = e2-jar8`):\n",
    "\n",
    "The `label` attribute gives a general indication of the meaning of the Sumerian word but is not context-sensitive. That is, the `label` of \"lugal\" is always \"king\", even if in context the word means \"owner\". The `pos` attribute gives the Part of Speech, but again the attribute is not context-sensitive. Where a verb (such as sag₉, to be good) is used as an adjective the `pos` is still \"V\" (for verb). Together `lemma`, `label`, and `pos` define a Sumerian lemma (dictionary entry).\n",
    "\n",
    "In parsing the [ETCSL] files we will be looking for the `<w>` and `</w>` tags to isolate words and their attributes. Higher level tags identify lines (`<l>` and `</l>`), versions, secondary text (found only in a minority of sources), etcetera.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [ETCSL] file set includes the [etcslmanual.html](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/edition2/etcslmanual.php) with explanations of the tags, their attributes, and their proper usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal of the parsing process is to get as much information as possible out of the `XML` tree in a format that is useful for computational text analysis. What \"useful\" means depends, of course, on the particular project. The output of the parser is a word-by-word (or rather lemma-by-lemma) representation of the entire [ETCSL] corpus in a format that is as close as possible to the output of the [ORACC] parser. For most projects it will be necessary to group words into lines or compositions, or to separate out a particular group of compositions. The data is formatted in a way that that can be achieved with a standard set of Python commands.\n",

    "A word in the [ETCSL] files is represented by a `<w>` node in the `XML` tree with a number of attributes that identify the `form` (transliteration), `citation form`, `guide word`, `part of speech`, etc. The function `getword()` formats the word as closely as possible to the [ORACC] conventions.

In [ORACC] a word has a single `pos`; for proper nouns this is DN, PN, GN, etc. - so what is `type` in [ETCSL] becomes `pos` in [ORACC]. [ORACC] proper nouns usually do not have a guide word (only a number to enable disambiguation of namesakes). The [ETCSL] guide words (`label`) for names come pretty close to ORACC citation forms. Proper nouns are therefore formatted differently from other nouns.\n",

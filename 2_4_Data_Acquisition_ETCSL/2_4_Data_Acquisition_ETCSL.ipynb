The [ETCSL] lemmatizations are made compatible with [ORACC] standards (see [ePSD2](http://oracc.org/epsd2/sux), so that [ETCSL] and [ORACC] data can be mixed and matched for text analysis purposes.\n",

    "\n",
    "A word in the [ETCSL] files is represented by a `<w>` node in the `XML` tree with a number of attributes that identify the `form` (transliteration), `citation form`, `guide word`, `part of speech`, etc. The function `getword()` formats the word as closely as possible to the [ORACC] conventions. Three different types of words are treated in three different ways: Proper Nouns, Sumerian words and Emesal words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [ETCSL] **proper nouns** are nouns (`pos` = \"N\"), which are qualified by an additional attribute `type` (Divine Name, Personal Name, Geographical Name, etc.; abbreviated as DN, PN, GN, etc.). In [ORACC] a word has a single `pos`; for proper nouns this is DN, PN, GN, etc. - so what is `type` in [ETCSL] becomes `pos` in [ORACC]. [ORACC] proper nouns usually do not have a guide word (only a number to enable disambiguation of namesakes). The [ETCSL] guide words (`label`) for names come pretty close to ORACC citation forms. Proper nouns are therefore formatted differently from other nouns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sumerian words** are essentially treated in the same way in [ETCSL] and [ORACC], but the `citation forms` and `guide words` are often different. Transformation of citation forms and guide words to [ORACC]/[epsd2] standards takes place in the function `etcsl_to_oracc()` (see above, section 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emesal words** in [ETCSL] use their Sumerian equivalents as `citation form` (attribute `lemma`), adding a separate attribute (`emesal`) for the Emesal form proper. This Emesal form is the one that is used as `citation form` in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `getword()` uses the dictionary `meta_d` which has collected all the meta-data (text ID, composition name, version, line number, etc.) of this particular word It produces the dictionary `word` which is sent to the function `etcsl_to_oracc()`\n",

The versions may be distinguished as 'Version A' vs. 'Version B' or may indicate the provenance of the version ('A version from Urim' vs. 'A version from Nibru'). In the edition of the proverbs the same mechanism is used to distinguish between numerous tablets (often lentils) that contain just one proverb, or a few, and are collected in the files \"Proverbs from Susa,\" \"Proverbs from Nibru,\" etc. ([ETCSL] c.6.2.1 - c.6.2.5).\n",

The function checks to see if versions are available in the file that is being parsed. If so, the function iterates over these versions while adding the version name to the `meta_d` dictionary. If there are no versions, the version name is left empty. The parsing process is continued by calling `getsection()` to see if the composition/version is further divided into sections.\n",

The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (ETCSL)
Revised edition
Oxford, October 2006

This readme file describes briefly the ETCSL corpus files deposited with the Arts and Humanities Data Service, Languages and Linguistics hosted by the Oxford Text Archive at the University of Oxford (http://ahds.ac.uk/litlangling/index.htm), as part of the outcome of the Arts and Humanities Research Council award no. B/RG/AN189/APN18553.

For details about the encoding of the corpus, please see the manual (etcslmanual.html). More information about the corpus and the project it came out of can be found at http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/.

* Corpus files
The corpus files are located in three separate subdirectories, one for the transliterations (composite files), one for the translations, and one for the bibliography file. All these files are in XML ASCII Windows pc format.

* TEI
The tei subdirectory contains the TEI files (dtds, etc.) necessary for validating the ETCSL corpus.

* Other files
All other files, e.g. the corpus header, the TEI extension files, the full catalogue, and the manual are in the current, etcsl, directory.

* Parsing/Validating
The corpus has been validated with SP, "An SGML System Conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language" (http://www.jclark.com/sp/), before deposit.

    "This will create windows of the size `n`. Increasing `n` will increase the number of collocates and the time it takes to produce them. Thne minimum size of `n` is 2, which will only consider words that are immediately adjacent. Larger window sizes may capture the general theme of the passage from which the window is taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each window the function `combinations()` (from the `itertool` library) is used to produce all possible combinations of 2 words in that window. With a 7-word window length, a sequence such as en-lil₂ kur gal-ra šulgi lugal-e e₂ mu-na-du₃ (\"Šulgi the king build a temple for Great Mountain Enlil\") will yield the following 21 word pairs as tuples:  \n",

    "# TODO: edit the text below and make decisions about stop word list\n",
    "The following cell is used to remove very frequent and/or very rare lemmas, based on `min_count` and `max_count` thresholds. The variable `min_count` is currently set to 15. For low-frequency words the current approach is not reliable; the best setting of this parameter is still subject to further research and may well depend on the corpus that is being used for analysis. The variable `max_count` currently equals the total number of tokens in the corpus, which means that no [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word) are discarded. For Sumerian, it is not obvious which words should count as stop words since Sumerian barely uses pronouns (where used they are highly significant) and has few true function words. For the Ur III corpus, one could designate words for units such as **gur**, **giŋ**, and **sila**, or time units such as **ud** (day) and **itud** (month) as stop words, since they add little indeed to the content of the documents. However, the other hand, the association of **gur**, **sila**, etc. with some commodities (counted by volume) and not with others (counted by piece or weight, etc.) is exactly the kind of information that is captured well with PMI.

The dictionary `x2i` is used to translate each lemma into an index number and append the numbers to the lists `rows` and `cols`. The third element that the matrix function need is `data`. Instead of simply entering the frequency in `data` we enter the PPMI score. The formula for PMI is  $$log\\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)}$$; that is: the logarithm of the probability of encountering x *and* y, divided by the probability of x times the probability of y. The probabilities are computed by dividing the frequency of x and y by the total number of tokens and dividing the frequency of (x, y) by the total number of collocates.\n",

    "The following cells provide an interactive tool for analyzing the word vectors that were produced with PMI and SVD. The output is a Pandas DataFrame with nearby neighbors, that is, words that are represented by vectors that are relatively close to the vector of target word. One may restrict the output by Part of Speech and the output includes links to the [ePSD2](http://oracc.org/epsd2) pages for these words. The links to [ePSD2](http://oracc.org/epsd2) depend on the stable OID numbers (Oracc Identifiers). All Sumerian words have OIDs, but many proper nouns still have temporary Citation Forms and Guide Words and therefore have no OID. Such words/names do have dictionary pages, but those pages must be found by searching in [ePSD2/admin/ur3/qpn](http://oracc.org/epsd2/admin/ur3/qpn)."

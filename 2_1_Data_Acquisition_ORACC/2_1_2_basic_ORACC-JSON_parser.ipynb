    "# Extract Lemmatization from ORACC JSON: Basic Parser\n",
    "The code in this notebook will parse [ORACC](http://oracc.org) `JSON` files to extract lemmatization data for one or more projects. The resulting `csv` (Comma Separated Values) file is named `parsed.csv` and has two fields: a Text ID (e.g. `dcclt/Q000039`) and a string of lemmas in the format `lugal[king]N` (or `Å¡arru[king]N` for Akkadian texts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the Basic Parser contains *only* text IDs and lemmas. This format is useful for so-called [bag of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) techniques such as word clouds or [topic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model). The `JSON` files, however, contain a wealth of other data, including language (Sumerian, Akkadian, Emesal, etc.), orthographic form, morphology (currently only for Sumerian and Emesal), line numbers, breakage, etc. The extended JSON parser notebook, building upon the techniques demonstrated here, will show how to extract any type of data."

The function goes down this hierarchy by calling itself when another `cdl` node is encountered.

Iterating through these dictionaries, if a dictionary contains another `cdl` node, the function calls itself with this lower-level dictionary as argument. This way the function digs deeper and deeper into the `JSON` tree, until it does not encounter a `cdl` key anymore. Here we are at the level of individual words. The code checks for a key `f`, if it exists the value of that key (another dictionary) is appended to the list `l`. The list `l` will become a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single word and the list represents the vocabulary of a single text with the words in their original order.\n",

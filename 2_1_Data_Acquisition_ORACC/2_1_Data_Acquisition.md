# 2.1 Data Acquisition: [ORACC](http://oracc.org)
[ORACC](http://oracc.org) (the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus) is an umbrella project for the online publication of cuneiform texts. [ORACC](http://oracc.org) counts several dozens of independent projects, some with one or more sub-projects. Corpus-based projects include editions and translations of cuneiform texts with linked local glossaries. [ORACC](http://oracc.org) was created by Steve Tinney (University of Pennsylvania) in 2006.

[ORACC](http://oracc.org) data are made available as open data in JSON format under the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license (public domain). JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a file format that is used widely for exchanging data between programs or between web sites. The file format is simple and straightforward, but allows for complex representations of data in a hierarchical format (not unlike XML). The structure of JSON files is very easy to read and parse in Python and in many other programming languages.

The sections that follow explain how the [ORACC](http://oracc.org) JSON is parsed and how the data can be reformatted in various ways. This is rather technical in nature and perhaps not a very interesting place to start (there are no research results to be reported or to be evaluated at the end). Proper data acquisition is foundational for all computational research. *What* data are collected (transliteration, transcription, or a series of lemmas) and in what *format* they are collected (word-by-word, line-by-line, or text-by text) depends on the research question and therefore the acquisition techniques discussed below are flexible and allow the user to adjust the code to her or his needs. The analytical chapters (Chapter 3-6) will provide the data in the required format and thus the present section is not necessary to follow along. The reader who wishes to devise her own research project - and format the data accordingly - will require a deeper understanding of the JSON format and the techniques for parsing the data.

The field `id_word` consists of three parts, namely a text ID, line ID, and word ID, in the format `Q000039.76.2` meaning: the second word in line 76 of text object `Q000039`. Note that `76` is not a line number strictly speaking but an object reference within the text object. Things like horizontal rulings, columns, and breaks also get object references. The `id_word` field allows us to put lines, breaks, and horizontal rulings together in the proper order.\n",

    "The field `label` is a human-legible label that refers to a line or another part of the text; it may look like `o i 23` (obverse column 1 line 23) or `r v 23'` (reverse column 5 line 23 prime). The `label` field is used in online [ORACC](http://oracc.org) editions to indicate line numbers.\n",

    "The fields `extent`, `scope`, and `state` give metatextual data about the condition of the object; they capture the number of broken lines or columns and similar information. \n",

    "The field `field` is used primarily in lexical texts. For the field abbreviations and their meanings, see the [documentation](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/help/editinginatf/lexicaltexts/index.html). The field label looks like `wp` (word or phrase), or `sg` (Sign) and is found under the JSON key `subtype` after a `field-start` entry. The field label is copied to the `meta_d` dictionary (under the key `field`), but this key is removed from `meta_d` as soon as the parser encounters a `field-end` value (with the `pop()` method). The great majority of lemmas have no field attribute - the key is \"popped\" so that it does not inadvertently get copied to all subsequent lemmas. Administrative text may have a `field` indicating that a word belongs to a year name (`yn`). This may be used, for instance, to remove yearnames in analyzing the vocabulary of the Ur III corpus.\n",

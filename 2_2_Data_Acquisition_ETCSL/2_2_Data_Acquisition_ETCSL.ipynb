    "\n",
    "The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature ([ETCSL]; 1998-2006) provides editions and translations of 394 Sumerian literary compositions. Goal of this Notebook is to format the [ETCSL] data in such a way that the (lemmatized) texts are made available for computational text analysis. The [ETCSL] lemmatizations are made compatible with [ORACC] standards (see [ePSD2](http://oracc.org/epsd2/sux)), so that [ETCSL] and [ORACC] data can be mixed and matched for text analysis purposes.\n",

    "\n",
    "A word in the [ETCSL] files is represented by a `<w>` node in the `XML` tree with a number of attributes that identify the `form` (transliteration), `citation form`, `guide word`, `part of speech`, etc. The function `getword()` formats the word as closely as possible to the [ORACC] conventions. Three different types of words are treated in three different ways: Proper Nouns, Sumerian words and Emesal words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [ETCSL] **proper nouns** are nouns (`pos` = \"N\"), which are qualified by an additional attribute `type` (Divine Name, Personal Name, Geographical Name, etc.; abbreviated as DN, PN, GN, etc.). In [ORACC] a word has a single `pos`; for proper nouns this is DN, PN, GN, etc. - so what is `type` in [ETCSL] becomes `pos` in [ORACC]. [ORACC] proper nouns usually do not have a guide word (only a number to enable disambiguation of namesakes). The [ETCSL] guide words (`label`) for names come pretty close to ORACC citation forms. Proper nouns are therefore formatted differently from other nouns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sumerian words** are essentially treated in the same way in [ETCSL] and [ORACC], but the `citation forms` and `guide words` are often different. Transformation of citation forms and guide words to [ORACC]/[epsd2] standards takes place in the function `etcsl_to_oracc()` (see above, section 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emesal words** in [ETCSL] use their Sumerian equivalents as `citation form` (attribute `lemma`), adding a separate attribute (`emesal`) for the Emesal form proper. This Emesal form is the one that is used as `citation form` in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `getword()` uses the dictionary `meta_d` which has collected all the meta-data (text ID, composition name, version, line number, etc.) of this particular word It produces the dictionary `word` which is sent to the function `etcsl_to_oracc()`\n",

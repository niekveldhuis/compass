    "# 2.4 Data Acquision BDTNS\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal of this notebook is to transform [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/) data into a structured format that clearly distinguishes between text and non-text (such as line numbers) and that, for the text part, follows as much as possible the standards of the Oracc Global Sign List ([OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl)). Adherence to the [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) standard makes it possible to transform a line of text into a sequence of sign names or Unicode codepoints. This can be used to track transliteration inconsistencies, for instance in the rendering of names (U₂-da-mi-ša-ru-um vs. U₂-ta₂-mi-ša-ru-um), to build a search engine that finds a sign sequence regardless of the actual transliteration, or to compare editions of the same text in [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/), [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu), and [ePSD2](http://oracc.org/epsd2/admin/u3adm).\n",
    "\n",
    "The search engine will be built in a separate notebook - primarily as a case study of the potential of this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/) website, search results can be downloaded with the \"Export\" button in the left pane. Searching for the empty string will select all texts currently available. The export creates two files: one with transliterations and one with meta-data. The transliteration file is discussed here most extensively. The file name is \"query\\_text\\_\" followed by a date and an additional number. Move the file to the `data` directory of this chapter and make sure that the variable `file` corresponds to your file name and file location.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the `pandas` integration of the `tqdm` package, for showing a progress bar. This is important, because the the transformation of (currently) more than 1.1 million lines of text in [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) takes some time. The pandas/tqdm integration is initialized with `tqdm.pandas()`, immediately after importing `tqdm`. This allows the usage of the functions `progress_apply()` and `progress_map()` instead of the standard `apply()` and `map()` functions in `pandas`."

The Python `readlines()` function (which reads a file line-by-line, producing a list) is memory efficient, but keeps the vertical tabs and will result in a format where each document is represented as a single line. Instead, therefore, we read the entire file into memory with the `read()` function and then split the document into lines with `splitlines()`. The function `splitlines()` takes the vertical tab (as well as the regular newline character) as a line separator; this will result in a line-by-line representation of the document in the form of a list (called `bdtns`).\n",

If such a line is found, the number is stored in the variable `bdtns_no`. Other data available in such lines (such as publication and [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) P-number) are omitted, because they are better derived from the meta-data file (with the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) number as key).\n",
    "\n",

The variables `id_text` (the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) number) and `id_line` are added to each line as separate fields. The field `id_line` is a running number (an integer) that starts at 1 for each document. In the current notebook the variable is not used, but it can be used to keep or restore the proper order of the lines of a document. The variable `label` is the human-readable line number in the format 'r ii 7' (for reverse column 2 line 7).\n",

Finally, sign names (qualifying x-values, rare signs, and, occasionally, readings with exclamation mark) are marked by '(=' (as in '(=SIG7)'). In the script, the five spaces are replaced by '#' and '(=' is replaced by '#(=' so that we can split each line on the hash mark. The `replace()` function is done only once and `split()` is done twice, so that we end up with three columns, representing label, text, and comments (to which the `id_text` and `id_line` are added).

    "Some x-values are always resolved in the same way. Thus, ziX is always ziₓ(IGI@g), hirinX is always hirinₓ(KWU318), and gurX is always gurₓ(|ŠE.KIN|). In some cases, x-values have been assigned an index number in [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl). In those cases (nigarₓ = nigar; nemurₓ(PIRIG.TUR) = nemur₂; nagₓ(GAZ) = nag₃; and pešₓ(ŠU.PEŠ5) = peš₁₄) the appropriate index number is added and the sign name is ignored.\n",

    "The `sub()` function of the `re` library has the general form `re.sub(search_pattern, replace, string)`. Instead of a replace string, one may also give a function (in this case a temporary `lambda` function) that returns the `replace` string. In this case the `lambda` function accesses the dictionary `xvalues` to see if the match that was found in the search pattern is present among the keys. The basic format of that command is `xvalues.get(m.group())`, where `m.group()` represents the current match of the search pattern. The search pattern, `xv` (to be explained in more detail below) may match `zahX`, `NigarX`, or `[bu]lugX` - in other words, the match may include capitals (as in `NigarX`) or brackets and flags (as in `[bu]lugX`). In order to find that match in the dictionary it is lowercased and \"translated\". The function `translate()` translates individual characters into other characters - according to a translation pattern in a table. In this case, the characters representing flags and brackets are all translated to `None` which means, in practice, that they are removed. The matches `zahX`, `NigarX`, and `[bu]lugX`, therefore, will be looked up in the dictionary as `zahx`, `nigarx`, and `bulugx` - and each of those are indeed keys in `xvalues`. In the `get()` function one may optionally add a fall-back value in case the key is not found - in this case the fall-back is 'X'. \n",

    "If a match is found, say `[bu]lugX`, the key `bulugx` is found in the dictionary `xvalues`, returning `ₓ(|ŠIM×KUŠU₂|)`. The return value of the lambda function is the search match (`[bu]lugX`) minus the last character (`[bu]lug`) plus the value that was returned from the dictionary (`ₓ(|ŠIM×KUŠU₂|)`), resulting in `[bu]lugₓ(|ŠIM×KUŠU₂|)`. If the search pattern returns a match that is not found in the dictionary (for instance `ušurX`), the return value of the lambda function is, again, the search match (`ušurX`), minus the last character (`ušur`) plus `X`, the fallback return of the `get()` function, resulting in `ušurX`. In other words - in those cases the search match is replaced by itself and nothing changes.\n",

This regex will match `ziX`, `zahX`, or `ušurX`, but also `[za]hX`, etc. It does not match 'KA×X', ' X', or 'x-X', because the characters × (for 'times') the hyphen and the space are neither word characters nor flags.\n",

The regular expression `xv` in the preceding does not match hyphens and thus it will never find the key `mu-kuX` in the dictionary `xvalues`. However, this expression (meaning 'delivery') is so frequent that it makes sense to deal with it separately, rather than depend on the sign names in the `comments` column.
